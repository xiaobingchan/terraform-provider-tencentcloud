  availability_zone  = data.tencentcloud_redis_zone_config.zone.list[0].zone
  type_id            = data.tencentcloud_redis_zone_config.zone.list[0].type_id
  password           = "test12345789"
  mem_size           = 8192
  redis_shard_num    = data.tencentcloud_redis_zone_config.zone.list[0].redis_shard_nums[0]
  redis_replicas_num = data.tencentcloud_redis_zone_config.zone.list[0].redis_replicas_nums[0]
  name               = "terrform_test"
  port               = 6379
}
```
