# tencentcloud_mysql_readonly_instance

Provides a mysql instance resource to create read-only database instances.

~> **NOTE:** The terminate operation of read only mysql does NOT take effect immediately, maybe takes for several hours. so during that time, VPCs associated with that mysql instance can't be terminated also.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "tencentcloud_mysql_readonly_instance" "default" {
  master_instance_id = "cdb-dnqksd9f"
  instance_name      = "myTestMysql"
  mem_size           = 128000
  volume_size        = 255
  vpc_id             = "vpc-12mt3l31"
  subnet_id          = "subnet-9uivyb1g"
  intranet_port      = 3306
  security_groups    = ["sg-ot8eclwz"]

  tags = {
    name = "test"
  }
}
```
