# tencentcloud_cos_bucket

Provides a COS resource to create a COS bucket and set its attributes.

## Example Usage

Private Bucket

```hcl
resource "tencentcloud_cos_bucket" "mycos" {
  bucket = "mycos-1258798060"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

Static Website

```hcl
resource "tencentcloud_cos_bucket" "mycos" {
  bucket = "mycos-1258798060"

  website = {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"
  }
}
```

Using CORS

```hcl
resource "tencentcloud_cos_bucket" "mycos" {
  bucket = "mycos-1258798060"
  acl    = "public-read-write"

  cors_rules {
    allowed_origins = ["http://*.abc.com"]
    allowed_methods = ["PUT", "POST"]
    allowed_headers = ["*"]
    max_age_seconds = 300
    expose_headers  = ["Etag"]
  }
}
```

Using object lifecycle

```hcl
resource "tencentcloud_cos_bucket" "mycos" {
  bucket = "mycos-1258798060"
  acl    = "public-read-write"

  lifecycle_rules {
    filter_prefix = "path1/"

    transition {
      date          = "2019-06-01"
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }

    expiration {
      days = 90
    }
  }
}
```
