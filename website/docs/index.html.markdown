# TencentCloud Provider

The TencentCloud provider is used to interact with many resources supported by [TencentCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com).
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation on the left to read about the available resources.

-> **Note:** Terraform 0.12.x support began with provider version 1.9.0 (June 18, 2019), 

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the TencentCloud Provider
provider "tencentcloud" {
  secret_id  = var.secret_id
  secret_key = var.secret_key
  region     = var.region
}

# Create a web server
resource "tencentcloud_instance" "web" {
  instance_name              = "web example"
  availability_zone          = "ap-guangzhou-3"
  image_id                   = "img-9qabwvbn"
  instance_type              = "S1.SMALL1"
  system_disk_type           = "CLOUD_PREMIUM"
  key_name                   = tencentcloud_key_pair.my_ssh_key.id
  security_groups            = [tencentcloud_security_group.default.id]
  internet_max_bandwidth_out = 20
  count                      = 1
}

# Create key pair with your public key
resource "tencentcloud_key_pair" "my_ssh_key" {
  key_name   = "from_terraform_public_key"
  public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaSuperLongString foo@bar"
}

# Create security group with 2 rules
resource "tencentcloud_security_group" "default" {
  name        = "web accessibility"
  description = "make it accessible for both production and stage ports"
}

resource "tencentcloud_security_group_rule" "web" {
  security_group_id = tencentcloud_security_group.default.id
  type              = "ingress"
  cidr_ip           = "0.0.0.0/0"
  ip_protocol       = "tcp"
  port_range        = "80,3000,8080"
  policy            = "accept"
}

resource "tencentcloud_security_group_rule" "ssh" {
  security_group_id = tencentcloud_security_group.default.id
  type              = "ingress"
  cidr_ip           = "202.119.230.10/32"
  ip_protocol       = "tcp"
  port_range        = "22"
  policy            = "accept"
}
```

## Authentication

The TencentCloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication.
The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Assume role
- Environment variables

### Static credentials ###

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `secret_id` `secret_key` and `region` in-line in the tencentcloud provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  secret_id  = var.secret_id
  secret_key = var.secret_key
  region     = var.region
}
```

## Assume Role ###

If provided with an assume role, Terraform will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials. Assume role can be provided by adding an `assume_role_arn`, `assume_role_session_name`, `assume_role_session_duration` and `assume_role_policy`(optional) in-line in the tencentcloud provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  secret_id  = var.secret_id
  secret_key = var.secret_key
  region     = var.region
  assume_role {
    role_arn         = var.assume_role_arn
    session_name     = var.session_name
    session_duration = var.session_duration
    policy           = var.policy
  }
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID` and `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY`, environment variables,
representing your TencentCloud Access Key and Secret Key, respectively. `TENCENTCLOUD_REGION`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME` and `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION` are also used, if applicable:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {}
```

Usage:

```shell
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID="your_fancy_accesskey"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY="your_fancy_secretkey"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_REGION="ap-guangzhou"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN="your_fancy_assume_role_arn"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME="your_fancy_assume_role_session_name"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION=5
$ terraform plan
```

## Argument Reference

In addition to generic provider arguments (e.g. alias and version), the following arguments are supported in the TencentCloud provider block:

* `secret_id` - This is the TencentCloud access key. It must be provided, but it can also be sourced from the `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID` environment variable.
* `secret_key` - This is the TencentCloud secret key. It must be provided, but it can also be sourced from the `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
* `security_token` - TencentCloud Security Token of temporary access credentials. It can be sourced from the `TENCENTCLOUD_SECURITY_TOKEN` environment variable. Notice: for supported products, please refer to: [temporary key supported products](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10588).
* `region` - This is the TencentCloud region. It must be provided, but it can also be sourced from the `TENCENTCLOUD_REGION` environment variables. The default input value is ap-guangzhou.
* `assume_role` - (Optional) An `assume_role` block (documented below). If provided, terraform will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials. Only one `assume_role` block may be in the configuration.
The nested `assume_role` block supports the following:
* `role_arn`-(Required) The ARN of the role to assume. It can be sourced from the `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN`.
* `session_name`-(Required) The session name to use when making the AssumeRole call. It can be sourced from the `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME`.
* `session_duration`-(Required)The duration of the session when making the AssumeRole call. Its value ranges from 0 to 43200(seconds), and default is 7200 seconds. It can be sourced from the `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION`.
* `policy`-(Optional) A more restrictive policy to apply to the temporary credentials. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed.


## Testing

Credentials must be provided via the `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID`, and `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY` environment variables in order to run acceptance tests.
